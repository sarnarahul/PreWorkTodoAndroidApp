## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Being an iOS Developer it was easy to understand how the basics have been setup for Android. 
Plus, with the help of excellent CodePath video walkthroughs, 
completing the basic was not that difficult. I would definitely do the optionals but to keep the app
robust I would just want to submit the basic version.
